# Infectious Disease data

This directory contains data for making a booth about the spread of infectious diseases.

## Zika

The zika data comes from [Allison Black](https://bedford.io/team/allison-black/) in the [Bedford Lab](https://bedford.io/).

[`zika_columbia.csv`](zika_columbia.csv): Case counts for zika infections in Columbia. This data comes from Alli's new paper which was just submitted. This data is much cleaner and needs very little pre-processing.

[`zika_southAmerica.csv`](zika_southAmerica.csv): Case counts for Zika infections in several South American countries. Alli says the data is from PAHO. This data is much messier.

### Ideas

I was thinking you could start with the columbian data and maybe just make some exploratory bar graphs? Ask questions like when did the infections peak?

Next would be learning how to clean data with the South American dataset.

Finally, making some cool graphs with [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/choropleth-maps/)

And obviously, learning about epidemiology and zika virus specifically
